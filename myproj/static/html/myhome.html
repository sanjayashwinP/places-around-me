    <h1>where i lived for past 17 years with my family.
         my home is a welcoming sanctuary that resonates with warmth and familiarity. 
         The exterior, adorned with a quaint garden and a white picket fence, exudes a timeless charm. 
         Stepping inside, the cozy living room is bathed in natural light, creating a comfortable space for relaxation. 
         The kitchen, the heart of our home, echoes with the delightful sounds of shared meals and laughter. 
         upstairs, each bedroom reflects individual personalities, making our home a canvas of memories and shared experiences.</h1>
